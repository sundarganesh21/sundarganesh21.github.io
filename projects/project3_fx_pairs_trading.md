# Project 3: Cointegration and Pairs Trading

In this mini-project, we look into mean-reversion algorithms for FX trading. For some curency pairs whose countries have close economic and geographical ties (GBP-EUR, AUS-NZD), their exchange rate can be mean-reverting, i.e., short term fluctuations usually trend back towards a mean value. When an exchange rate displays such mean-reverting behaviour, a simple trading-strategy can be proposed where we buy/sell currency when there are large deviations of the exchange rate from its mean value, since we expect that it trends back to its mean value.
